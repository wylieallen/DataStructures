# DataStructures
A collection of simple data structure implementations and their supporting unit tests, developed according to TDD principles.

This project is a sandbox I'm using to brush up on data structures fundamentals while practicing writing tests. Many of these classes use dependency inversion to support varying the implementations of their backing structures.

## Lists

SinglyLinkedList: A simple linked list that supports a few extra operations besides those defined by the List interface.

## Queues

ListQueue: A simple FIFO queue backed by a list. 

StacksQueue: A FIFO queue backed by two stacks. Based on an exercise from CTCI.

## Stacks

ListStack: A simple LIFO stack backed by a list.

SegmentedStack: A composite stack of stacks. Based on another CTCI exercise.

## Trees

BSTNode: A binary search tree implementation with preorder, inorder and postorder iterators.

## Todo

More trees, graphs, maps
